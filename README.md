## RAG using Langchain
This project leverages Langchain framework to build RAG pipeline and uses streamlit to create temporary frontend for user interaction. 

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that combines the strengths of both retrieval- and generative-based artificial intelligence (AI) models.
